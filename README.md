# Course_Recommendations_ML_Capstone

This project is a good sourse of better understanding on content-based and collaborative filtering based recommender systems. At the beginning, I provides the recommendations for the courses based on user profile and course similarity matrix and then user profile clustering. At last, different collaborative filtering models such as KNN, NMF, SVD, NN with embeddings have been developed and evaluated through Root Means Square Error (RMSE). 
The main objective of the analysis is to focus on the recommender systems to build a better model to provide the recommendations for the courses.
